Trust on system to decide the Block-size. System decided blocksieze is most efficient.
providing BLKSIZE=0 will do the same
Give enough primary space so that, it will require secondary space in rare conditions.
Always code RLSE on DD statement space parameter
Coding ROUND with CYL option can give some performance gain
Prefer REGION parameter on JOB than step. Give enough big number for region if Job deals with Tape files.
DFSORT and SYNCSORT should be preferred over basic IBM utilities like IEBGENER as they are faster
Prefer DB2 Load/ unload utilities over Cobol-DB2 programs whenever possible. 
Use odd number for BUFNO parameter and avoid number greater than 35
